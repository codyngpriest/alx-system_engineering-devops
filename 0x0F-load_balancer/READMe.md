0x0F. Load balancer

Tasks

0. Double the number of webservers
In this first task you need to configure web-02 to be identical to web-01. Fortunately, you built a Bash script during your web server project, and they’ll now come in handy to easily configure web-02. Remember, always try to automate your work!

1. Install your load balancer
Install and configure HAproxy on your lb-01 server.
